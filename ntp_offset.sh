# This plugin expects to find ntpq and awk in the environment
# it reports the average ntp offset from ntpq in milliseconds.
#
# Example alarm code:
# :set consecutiveCount=3
# if (metric['ntp_offset'] > 10000 || metric['ntp_offset'] < -10000) {
#   return new AlarmStatus(CRITICAL, 'ntp offset is too high.');
# }
# return new AlarmStatus(OK, 'ntp offset is fine.');
#
# if (metric['active_sources'] < 2) {
#   return new AlarmStatus(WARNING, 'ntpd is only using #{active_sources} sources');
# }
# return new AlarmStatus(OK, 'ntpd has #{active_sources} active sources');
#
